Shashkrid

The name of this abstract strategy game is a neologism, from Sanskrit SaS, "six" and krIDA, "game".
It is a reference to the original Indian Chaturanga game, from which the modern variants of chess derive.

The game is played on a diamond-shaped 13 * 9 hex grid with a hole in its center.
The initial placement of the pieces is the same for every game (each "P" symbolises a pawn while a "o" is an unoccupied field):

                  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m
                9 o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o 9 
              8 P--P--P--P--P--P--P--o--o--o--o--o--o 8
            7 P--P--P--P--P--P--P--P--P--P--P--P--P 7
          6 o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o 6

Each turn a player is given three action points.
These may be used to either move pieces or promote pawns to special pieces that can perform more complex moves.
1. moving a piece costs one action point
2. promoting a piece costs one action point
No piece may be moved more than once per turn.
A pawn that has not been moved in the current turn and is not being touched by an opponent's piece can be promoted to become a martyr, a guardian, a lance or a serpent.
A piece that was promoted must not be moved in the same turn.
A player may only have up to two promoted pieces of the same type at a time.
They may not perform other promotions of the same type until the pieces in question have been captured by the opponent.
An opponent's piece may be captured if the sum of the attack values of one's own pieces adjacent to it, including the attacking piece, is greater or equal to the defence value of the target.
The attacker takes the captured piece's place.
A game ends in one of four ways.
1. the maximum number of turns has been played (26)
2. a player has lost all their pieces
3. a player concedes
4. the players agree to call it a draw
In the first case, the outcome of the game is determined by the number of grid points in the zone of control of each player.
The zone of control in each lane extends from the original side of the player to the furthest piece owner by the player, forming a line which may not be interrupted by an enemy piece nor the hole in the center.
The player with the higher numbers ones.
If they are equal, the game is a draw.
